# **📌 Malware analysis**
## **🧐 what is malware?**
    Any intrusive program created by cyber criminals (often referred to as "hackers") to steal data and harm or destroy computers and computer systems is referred to as malware, which is short for "malicious software."
Malware types that are frequently encountered include worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, and ransomware. 
## **☠️ Types of Malware**
* > ### **👿 1 adware**
        Adware displpencvays unwanted or harmful advertisements.
        While generally harmless, it can be annoying when "spammy" adverts keep popping up while   you're working and seriously impairing the functionality of your computer.
        Additionally, these advertisements might unintentionally encourage users to download more dangerous software.
        Keep your operating system, web browser, and email clients updated to prevent known adware attacks from downloading and installing. This will help you protect against adware. 
* > ### **🗂 2 Fileless Malware** 
        Fileless malware doesn't directly affect files or the file system, unlike classical malware,  which  infects machines through executable files.
        This kind of malware instead makes advantage of non-file objects like PowerShell, WMI,  Microsoft Office macros, and other system features.
        Operation Cobalt Kitty, in which the OceanLotus Group infiltrated many organizations  and  carried out covert operations for nearly six months before being discovered, is a  prominent instance of a fileless malware attack.
        It is difficult for antivirus software to defend against fileless malware because there isn't an  executable file.
        Make sure users only have the rights and privileges necessary for them to perform their duties in  order to protect yourself from it.
        This will lessen the chance of fraudsters using fireless malware to steal employee login  information and access private data.
        Moreover, disable 
* > ### **🦠 3 Virus**
        A virus infects other programs and can spread to other systems, in  addition to  performing its own maliciousness. The virus is attached to a  file and is executed once  the file is launched. The virus will then  encrypt, corrupt, delete or move your data and  files.
        To defend against viruses, an enterprise-level antivirus solution can  help you protect all  your devices from a single location while  maintaining central control and visibility. Make  sure that you run full  scans frequently and keep your antivirus definitions up to date.
* > ### **🤯 4 worms**
        A worm can propagate to other devices or systems, just like a virus does.
        A worm, however, does not spread to other programs.
        Worms frequently target well-known exploits.
        Therefore, you should ensure that every device has the most recent fixes installed in  order to defend yourself against worms.
        You can find suspicious files or links that might contain a worm by using firewalls and  email filters.
* > ### **🐎 5 Trojan**
        A trojan program pretends to be a legitimate one, but it is in fact malicious. A trojan can’t  spread by itself like a virus or worm, but  instead must be executed by its victim. A trojan  usually comes into your  network through email or is pushed to users as a link on a  website.  Because trojans rely on social engineering to get users to spread and   download, they can be more difficult to combat.
        The easiest way to defend against trojans is to never download or  install a piece of  software from an unknown source. Instead, make sure  employees only download  software from reputable developers and app  stores that you have already authorized.
* > ### **🤖 6 Bots**
        A bot is a piece of software that executes a task automatically and without user input.
        A computer that has a bot infestation can infect additional computers, forming a botnet.
        Hackers can then take control of this network of hacked PCs and use it to execute large- scale assaults, frequently without the device owner being aware of their involvement.
        Massive attacks like the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that in 2018 knocked  out the internet for the majority of the Eastern U.S. can be carried out by bots.
        Using technologies to identify whether traffic is originating from a real user or a bot is   one technique to manage bots.
        For instance, you can include CAPTCHAs in your forms to stop automated 
* > ### **💸 7 Ransomeware**
        Attacks using ransomware encrypt data on a device and keep it hostage   until the hacker is paid to decrypt it.
        The hacker may threaten to erase the data or disclose it if the ransom is not paid  by a certain date.
        Even if victims pay the cost, they frequently still lose their data, thus paying could  not help.
        Because they affect hospitals, telecommunications companies, railway networks,  and governmental offices, ransomware attacks are among the most noteworthy  malware  varieties.
        An excellent illustration is the WannaCry attack, which crippled a large number of  devices in more than 150 nations.
        Create routine off-site backups at a secure off-site location in addition to patching  and training staff on best practices for cyber hygiene to prevent them from clicking on  harmful links. 
* > ### **🚨 8 Spyware**
        Cybercriminals use spyware to monitor the activities of users. By  logging the keystrokes  a user inputs throughout the day, the malware can  provide access to user names,  passwords, and personal data.
        Much like other malware, antivirus software can help you detect and  eliminate spyware.  You can also use anti-tracking browser extensions to  keep spyware from following your  users from site to site.
## **🧑‍💻 Who develop malwares?**
    Malware is created by a wide range of people such as vandals, swindlers,  blackmailers, and other criminals. While the overwhelming majority of  malicious programs are designed to make money illegally, the motives  behind creating malware can range widely from pranks and activism, to  cyber theft, espionage, and other serious crimes. If you’re mystified as  to why someone would want to put so much effort into attacking your  computer or your mobile device, let’s take a moment to consider the type  of people that become malware creators… and how they benefit from  creating malware.
## **Detect Malicious emails** 
* >  ### 1 The message is sent from a public email domain
        No legitimate organisation will send emails from an address that ends ‘@gmail.com’.
        Not even Google.
        Except for some small operations, most organisations will have their own email domain and company accounts. For example, legitimate emails from Google will read ‘@google.com’.
        If the domain name (the bit after the @ symbol) matches the apparent sender of the email, the message is probably legitimate.
        By contrast, if the email comes from an address that isn’t affiliated with the apparent sender, it’s almost certainly a scam.

        The most obvious way to spot a bogus email is if the sender uses a public email domain, such as ‘@gmail.com’
* > ### 2 The domain name is misspelt
        There’s another clue hidden in domain names that provides a strong indication of phishing scams ­– unfortunately, it complicates our previous clue.

        The problem is that anyone can buy a domain name from a registrar. And although every domain name must be unique, there are plenty of ways to create addresses that are indistinguishable from the one that’s being spoofed.
* > ### 3 The email is poorly written
        You can often tell if an email is a scam if it contains poor spelling and grammar.
        Many people will tell you that such errors are part of a ‘filtering system’ in which cyber criminals target only the most gullible people.
        The theory is that if someone ignores clues about how the message is written, they’re less likely to pick up clues during the scammer’s endgame.
        However, this only applies to outlandish schemes like the oft-mocked Nigerian prince scam, to which you must be incredibly naive to fall victim.
        That, and scams like it, are manually operated: once someone takes to the bait, the scammer has to reply. As such, it benefits the crooks to ensure the pool of respondents contains only those who might believe the rest of the con.
        But this doesn’t apply to phishing.
* > ### 4 It includes infected attachments or suspicious links
        Phishing emails come in many forms. We’ve focused on emails in this article, but you might also get scam text messages, phone calls or social media posts.
        But no matter how phishing emails are delivered, they all contain a payload. This will either be an infected attachment you’re asked to download or a link to a bogus website.
        The purpose of these payloads is to capture sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, phone numbers and account numbers.
* > ### 5 The message creates a sense of urgency
        Scammers know that most of us procrastinate. We receive an email giving us important news, and we decide we’ll deal with it later.
        But the longer you think about something, the more likely you will notice things that don’t seem right.
        Maybe you realise that the organisation doesn’t contact you by that email address, or you speak to a colleague and learn that they didn’t send you a document.
        Even if you don’t get that ‘a-ha’ moment, returning to the message with a fresh set of eyes might help reveal its true nature.
        That’s why so many scams request that you act now, or else it will be too late. This has been evident in every example we’ve used so far.
        PayPal, Windows and Netflix provide regularly used services, and any problems with those statements could cause immediate inconveniences.
        The manufactured sense of urgency is equally effective in workplace scams.

Criminals know that we’re likely to drop everything if our boss emails us with a vital request, especially when other senior colleagues are supposedly waiting on us.
## **🔫 Malware hunting**
    Threat hunters analyze networks, systems, and devices for anomalies in order to proactively look for cyber threats as part of the threat hunting cybersecurity technique.
    An important method that enables analysts to thoroughly explore the attack surface and uncover malicious threats is proactive threat hunting.
    These sophisticated attackers frequently succeed in sneaking past the first endpoint protection  layers undetected.
    Threat hunting is not a reactive strategy like threat detection.
    The threat hunting method makes use of preventative measures to keep an eye on systems and  data as well as threat intelligence to spot and rank suspicious activities.
    Its main goal is to stop advanced persistent threats and sophisticated cyberattacks from destabilizing the network.

* > ### **🔬 Hypothesis**
        Creating a hypothesis is the first step in a threat hunt.
        The goal of the campaign is to investigate a threat hunter's theories, assertions, or  educated guesses about the types of malicious activities taking place, as well as how  and why threat actors are infiltrating an environment.
        In order to generate these hypotheses, threat hunters use the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, tactics, methods, and procedures (TTP), indicators of compromise (IOC), and threat intelligence.
        Network lateral movement is an example of an adversary's strategy. Cyber attackers  frequently use this behavior to nefariously snoop for specific data and assets. 

* > ### **🔭 Trigger**
        When an alert is triggered, the threat hunters use this trigger as a guide when identifying patterns and commonalities between incidents. Advanced threat detection tools make it possible for threat hunters to notice triggered alerts so they can begin the threat investigation process. A threat hunter’s developed hypothesis can also serve as a trigger within proactive hunting as new threats emerge.
* > ### **Threat intelligence data collection**

        The compilation of threat intelligence data is driven by threat hunting tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Managed Detection and Response (MDR), and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR). This library of security data supports the threat detection, investigation, and analysis process.
* > ### **Threat investigation**

        The threat investigation process relies on threat detection technologies to deep dive into suspicious activity to determine malicious behavior from benign, false alerts. Along with the security tools mentioned above, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) assists in providing contextual information gathered from monitored end-user devices.
* > ### **Response**

        Once suspicious activity is deemed malicious, security teams use the collected threat intelligence data to prepare an incident response strategy to take action against the confirmed attack. This could include deploying software patches, running a malware removal tool, or configuring changing in a cloud-based security platform.
